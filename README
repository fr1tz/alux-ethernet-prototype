Legions Of Light Pre-Alpha 1 (non-public)
=========================================

Legions Of Light is an independent experimental multiplayer FPS game.

This is a non-public pre-alpha version of the game intended for
testing the basic game concept. Pretty much all the art is borrowed
from Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet.

Known Issues
------------

- The game is still not very optimized in terms of speed, but the Linux version
  seems to run incredibly slow on systems with ATI graphics drivers (to the
  point where it's unplayable).
