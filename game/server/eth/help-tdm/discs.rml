<spush><font:Arial:20>The Disc<spop>

Every CAT carries a head-mounted disc launcher and two discs.

In mEthMatch there's only one kind of offensive disc: The slasher disc.
To throw a slasher disc, you first need to get a disc-lock on an enemy CAT. After you've aquired a disc-lock, you can launch a slasher disc by pressing @bind17.

<lmargin:0>These are the rules to get a disc-lock:
<lmargin:0>-<lmargin:10> Damage the target with a <a:cmd HowToPlay 5.2>Grenade</a>
<lmargin:0>-<lmargin:10> Hit the target with at least 4 of the 9 shots fired by the <a:cmd HowToPlay 6.1>Blaster</a>
<lmargin:0>-<lmargin:10> Land a direct hit on the target with the <a:cmd HowToPlay 6.1>Battle Rifle</a> (proximity explosions do not count)
<lmargin:0>A disc-lock only lasts for two seconds.

A slasher disc will track its target until it has hit it, missed it, was deflected by another disc, has bounced a few times or has expired. 

In addition to dealing some damage, a slasher disc will give 20 points of armor to the CAT that launched it when it hits its target.

To deflect an incoming disc, keep the crosshair over it until it's locked, then press @bind17.
