<lmargin:5>Every CAT carries a head-mounted disc launcher and two discs. Discs are removed from a CAT's inventory when launched and re-added when they return, explode or expire.

To deflect an incoming disc, keep the crosshair over it until it's locked, then press @bind17. 

<spush><font:Arial:24>Attacking with Discs<spop>

To attack with a disc, you first need to get a disc-lock on an enemy CAT. These are the ways to get a disc-lock:
<lmargin:10>-<lmargin:20>Damage the target with a <a:cmd Manual 6.4>Grenade</a>.
<lmargin:10>-<lmargin:20>Damage the target with a <a:cmd Manual 7.3>Mine</a>.
<lmargin:10>-<lmargin:20>Hit the target with at least 4 of the 9 shots fired by the <a:cmd Manual 6.1>Blaster</a>.
<lmargin:10>-<lmargin:20>Land a direct hit on the target with the <a:cmd Manual 6.2>Battle Rifle</a> (proximity explosions do not count).

<lmargin:5>A disc-lock only lasts for two seconds.
After you've aquired a disc-lock, you can:

<lmargin:10>-<lmargin:20> Launch a <a:cmd Manual 5.1>repel disc</a> <bitmap:share/hud/rotc/icon.repeldisc.20x20> by pressing @bind17.

<lmargin:10>-<lmargin:20> Launch an <a:cmd Manual 5.2>explosive disc</a> <bitmap:share/hud/rotc/icon.explosivedisc.20x20> by pressing @bind47.
