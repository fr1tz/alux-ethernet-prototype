Fundamentally there are two categories of weapons in Alux: Those that bypass a CAT's <a:cmd Manual 4.3>barrier</a> (using red/blue visuals) and those that bypass a CAT's <a:cmd Manual 4.2>shield</a> (using orange/green visuals).

Most weapons fall into the first category and thus will often require multiple hits in quick succession to cause an enemy CAT to lose a significant amount of health.
