Ethernet maps in Alux contain a number of territory surfaces and two teams fight over control of these surfaces. The player controls an "Alux", an immortal flying entity that has the ability to materialize and control different types of units in order to capture and defend these surfaces.

The game is won if the opposing team has lost all their territory surfaces and has no more means of recapturing them.
